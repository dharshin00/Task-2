# Cybersecurity Internship â€“ Task 2 

## Objective
Analyze a second phishing email example to reinforce threat detection skills and identify more real-world phishing tactics.

---

## What I Did

1. Used a new fake phishing email pretending to be from **Amazon Security**.
2. Saved the sample email in a file named `phishing sample.txt`.
3. Analyzed the email for:
   - Spoofed sender email address
   - Fear-based messaging (social engineering)
   - Suspicious domain/link
   - Urgent language
   - Dangerous file attachment
   - Generic greeting
4. Documented my findings in `Analysis report.md`.

## Tools Used

- Manual inspection of the email structure
- Knowledge of phishing, spoofing, and social engineering tactics
- Markdown formatting for clear reporting
